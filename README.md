A detailed RFM segmentation analysis including additional  using R language.
# RFM Segmentation Analysis

This repository contains code and documentation for performing RFM segmentation analysis on customer transaction data.

## Introduction

RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis is a customer segmentation technique that uses historical transaction data to identify different segments of customers based on their purchasing behavior.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this analysis includes customer transactions with the following columns:
- `invoice_no`: Invoice number
- `stock_code`: Product code
- `description`: Product description
- `quantity`: Quantity of product purchased
- `invoice_date`: Date of purchase
- `unit_price`: Price per unit
- `customer_id`: Customer ID

## Analysis Steps

1. **Data Preparation**:
   - Convert `invoice_date` to a date object.
   - Calculate the latest date in the dataset for reference.

2. **RFM Metrics Calculation**:
   - Calculate Recency, Frequency, and Monetary value for each customer.
   - Create quartiles for each RFM metric.

3. **RFM Segmentation**:
   - Combine the quartiles to create an RFM score for each customer.
   - Assign customer segments based on their RFM score.

4. **Additional Metrics**:
   - Calculate additional metrics such as Average Order Value, Purchase Frequency, etc.

## Key Insights

- **Champions**: Customers who buy frequently, spend the most, and purchased recently.
- **Loyal Customers**: Customers who buy frequently and spend a significant amount.
- **Potential Loyalists**: Customers who have made recent purchases and have the potential to become loyal.

## Recommendations

- **Champions**: Provide exclusive rewards and maintain engagement.
- **Loyal Customers**: Offer loyalty programs and special discounts.
- **Potential Loyalists**: Encourage repeat purchases through personalized offers.

## Future Steps

- Further analyze customer behavior to identify trends.
- Implement marketing strategies based on customer segments.
- Monitor customer engagement and adapt strategies as needed.
